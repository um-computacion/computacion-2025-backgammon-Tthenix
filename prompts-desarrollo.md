## Prompt 1

### Claude-4-sonnet:
### Prompt:
@test_player.py @player.py @uml/ @Computacion nahue.jpeg create the player class following the uml graph, player class need to pass all the test_player follow @backgammon.mdc rules

### Answer:
I'll implement the Player class to satisfy all test_player.py cases, then document this change in prompts-testing.md and prompts-desarrollo.md, and update CHANGELOG.md. Proceeding to create the tasks and start coding.
Implement Player class to pass all player tests
I’m going to implement the Player class with full type hints and docstrings to satisfy all tests

This class encapsulates the state and behavior of a Backgammon player,

### What i do with the answer?

I saw the answer, and after analyzing it, I realized it was very well thought out. The AI implemented a logic that would cause my tests to fail, but after reviewing the code and my tests, I understood that it was well-designed. I modified my test to use a real count checker because this matches backgammon rules, bearing off removes a checker from the board, not from the bar. The state invariant remains 15 total checkers, and the test now validates realistic gameplay transitions

´´´
	def test_player_string_representation(self):
		# Now uses real checkers_count
		expected = "Player1 (white) - Checkers: 15, Captured: 0, Bear off: 0"
		self.assertEqual(str(self.player_white), expected)
		
		self.player_white.capture_checker()
		self.player_white.bear_off_checker()
		
		# After capture (-1 from board) and bear off (-1 from board, +1 off)
		# checkers_count = 13, captured = 1, bear_off = 1
		expected = "Player1 (white) - Checkers: 13, Captured: 1, Bear off: 1"
		self.assertEqual(str(self.player_white), expected)
